**This is the repository which would explain the setup,features and how to run the project after complete development of the prototype of the proposed solution by Team Prime Innovators. 
This would also contain time stamps and commit timestamps along with our progress log in the 36 hour hackathon**

#  TIME STAMP AND PROGRESS RECORD 
**Commit TimeStamp** : 11:31 a.m. **Progress**- README.md file just created with basic info about what it would contain.

**Commit TimeStamp** : 11:56 a.m. **Progress**- Decided to make a index or landing page for the prototype ChemConnect , created index.html and added the html head setup for the ChemConnect landing page

**TimeStamp** : 12:54 p.m.  **Progress**- We have decided the basis structure and workflow of our prototype ChemConnect like after index page. We will like have login page, register page,homepage page in future and so we have been working on completing the index page accordingly and would try to add the completed html structure with clear head , body with respective sections like how it works, benefits , features etc and some basic styling in terms of our future vision by checkpoint1. The pages we are planning to build in future including the index page would mostly be static.
We have planned to make more of a frontend based and static prototype. 

**CheckPoint1 Commit TimeStamp** : 13:05 p.m.  **Progress** - We have like now completed the index page for the prototype and added all the code in the respected index.html page as per what features and things we decided.

**Upload TimeStamp: 13:15 p.m. PPT submitted by Team Prime Innovators in Round 1 of HackOrbit 2025 uploaded**

**CheckPoint2 Commit TimeStamp** : 14:05 p.m. **Progress** - We are currently working on the code for login and register page.We are still working on the ui,layout and basic local storage functionality but we have basically defined the files register.html and login.html. We plan to implement local storage to like store the user data as well as login and session for the time being as it is a static prototype.We are also planning to like define some demo users also for presentation purposes.

**Commit TimeStamp**: 14:42 p.m. **Progress** - We have like completed the code for the register page currently and have added it in the register.html file.We have implemented basic features like directing to login page , validation lines and local storage check.We are still working on the login page.

**CheckPoint3 Commit TimeStamp**: 4:03 p.m. **Progress**- We have now completed the code for the login page and added it in the respective login.html file.
We have implemented local storage check as well as demo users for our convenience in testing.Basically,The login page has somewhat same layout and is on same grounds as the register page.This would now redirect registered users after logging in to the main homepage which would be built later.There are similarities in functionality and features too with the register page as mostly the pages are static.

**CheckPoint4 Commit TimeStamp** : 6:00 p.m. **Progress** - We are currently planning and deciding the features which the homepage of prototype ChemConnect would have.We are like trying to build it on similar grounds as with the index page but with more features like request forms,supply forms and so on.We are also like trying to do some changes in the design and layout and make it much appealing as this would be the main page.As this would be the page which covers the main goal of our proposed solution and innovation we are giving as much as we could in this. We have like defined the homepage.html file currently in the repository and are actively working on the code in vsc.We have also planned to add user history and search section or so if possible along with local storage data storing.

**CheckPoint5 Commit TimeStamp** :  8:02 p.m.  **Progress** - We have completed the code of our main homepage with functionality as well as features we wanted like request form , supply form, search section , list of available items, contact supplier options , non ai chatbot assistant.We have also added improvements regarding the design and layout with respect to the index page.We have added as much as possible we could keeping in mind that currently our protoype would be static. We have now added the completed html code in the homepage.html file in our repository from vsc.

**Commit TimeStamp** : 8:49 p.m. **Progress**- We have fixed some issues in the chatbot code as the toggle window was not opening on clicking the chatbot icon.We have modifed the code by checking again for more issues other than this and added it again in the homepage.html file.

**Commit TimeStamp**: 11:28 p.m.  **Progress** - We have completed the setup for the supplier contact page which would contain the supplier information of the respective listed static sample items as well as dynamic items listed by the user for the time being as his/her data is stored in local storage.We will now be adding the respective code in the supplier_contact.html file after defining it and then pushing the code into it.This would be like a completion step towards our prototype  ChemConnect for now as we had planned it to be static and frontend based with somewhat functionality inclusion.We would do improvement or some changes or modifications later on if we feel that we are lagging in some aspects after mentorship too or if possible at some time tomorrow

**Commit TimeStamp** 12:16 a.m. **Progress** - We are finishing the work in README.md file by adding setup,features and how to run the project explanation as well as description below the Time Stamp and Progress Record 

**Commit TimeStamp** 12:18 a.m. **Progress** - We added the features description and explanation of our prototype ChemConnect and updated the README.md file

**Commit TimeStamp** 12:24 a.m. **Progress** - We added the how to use the website description and explanation of our prototype ChemConnect website and updated the README.md file

**Commit TimeStamp** 12:40 a.m. **Progress** - We added the setup description and explanation of our prototype ChemConnect website and updated the README.md file
