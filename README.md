**This is the repository which would explain the setup,features and how to run the project after complete development of the prototype of the proposed solution by Team Prime Innovators. 
This would also contain time stamps and commit timestamps along with our progress log in the 36 hour hackathon**


**Commit TimeStamp** : 11:31 a.m. **Progress**- README.md file just created with basic info about what it would contain.

**Commit TimeStamp** : 11:56 a.m. **Progress**- Decided to make a index or landing page for the prototype ChemConnect , created index.html and added the html head setup for the ChemConnect landing page

**TimeStamp** : 12:54 a.m   **Progress**- We have decided the basis structure and workflow of our prototype ChemConnect like after index page. We will like have login page, register page,homepage page in future and so we have been working on completing the index page accordingly and would try to add the completed html structure with clear head , body with respective sections like how it works, benefits , features etc and some basic styling in terms of our future vision by checkpoint1. The pages we are planning to build in future including the index page would mostly be static.
We have planned to make more of a frontend based and static prototype. 

**CheckPoint1 Commit TimeStamp** : 13:05 a.m.  **Progress** - We have like now completed the index page for the prototype and added all the code in the respected index.html page as per what features and things we decided.
